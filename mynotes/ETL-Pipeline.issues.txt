*Issues with ETL::Pipeline off the CPAN vine*

1. $ perl Makefile.PL
   whines about 'automanifest' with strict;

    no strict;
    automanifest;
    use strict;

2. string variable interpolation line 1120 ETL::Pipeline

    $class = "ETL::Pipeline::$action::$class";

    $class = "ETL::Pipeline::${action}::$class";
    # a colon a new letter in a variable name????!!!!

   Note: before $ make test 
         You want to make sure you pass the tests!!!

3. Did not want status print statements from ETL::Pipeline
   so I commented out 'say's in ETL::Pipeline.pm before
   installing the package ( before make install ).

   Did not want them bothering Mojolicious.

4.  When I place my '+Local' modules in {$PROJECT}/lib/Local. 
    You can NOT have sub-directories!
