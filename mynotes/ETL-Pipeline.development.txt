ETL-Pipeline Development

Could not find examples program on the internet.
Had to go by the POD and test programs 

1) Input to ETL::P

   Modified ETL/Pipeline/Input/DelimitedText.pm to
            {$PROJECT}/lib/Local/DelimitedTextUnicode.pm 
     Text::CSV::Unicode

2) Output 

   Could not find and example for a SQL module!

   Followed the POD and lib/ETL/Pipeline/Output/Perl.pm

   'configure' method 
      b) inserts uploaded file info into 'dataset' table

   'write_record' method
      a) inserts the worksheet into the 'datasheet' table
         with the first row of data
         Note: CSV files are considered to have one worksheet
      b) makes adjustments to the data
      c) inserts uploaded file data into 'data' table

   Placed my output modules in {$PROJECT}/lib/Local.
