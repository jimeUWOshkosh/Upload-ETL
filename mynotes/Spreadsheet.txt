      How to read an Excel file in Perl
---
 Then there are the low-level libraries reading files by different versions of 
Excel: Spreadsheet::ParseExcel can read Excel 95-2003 files, and 
Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX can read file in the Excel 2007 Open XML XLSX format. 
There is also Spreadsheet::XLSX, but as far as I can tell that's not 
recommended any more.

In addition there is also Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Simple that works at an 
abstraction level somewhere between the above two, but it has not been changes 
for quite some time and I am not sure if it is necessary at all. 
------------


ETL::Pipeline
   uses Text::CSV, Spreadsheet::ParseExcel and Spreadsheet::XLSX

   According to Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX's POD
      # see Spreadsheet::ParseExcel for further documentation

      But then a module inside of ETL::Pipeline could not open the file.

Final output struggle 

CSV
   Copied ETL:P::Input::DelimitedText.pm to DelimitedTextUnicode.pm
   Change Text::CSV to Text::CSV::Unicode

XLS/XLSX
   Input
      ETL:P::Input::Excel.pm worked fine
   Output
      XLSX had to use Encode's decode on text attribute before inserting
         into the database.

Input
   Created data files (CSV, XLS, XLSX) to have employee-ish kinda of info.
Output
   Had to create my own output modules to insert into my data specific
   layout to hold employee-ish kind of info
